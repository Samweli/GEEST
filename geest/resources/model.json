Isochrones are derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network with the use of travel distances or times as input to estimate ease of access to the input locations at five incrementally increasing measurement intervals. The largest interval being the maximum distance or time women would travel to reach these locations. The algorithm produces five catchment areas based on the road network. A scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 is assigned to the catchment area polygons, reflecting the decreasing order of accessibility. Areas outside these catchment areas receive a score of zero.Step 1: This step is repeated for each facility type.  Input: Point locations (.shp) of amenities related to women's role as caregivers, including childcare, primary and secondary schools, markets, grocery stores and recreational areas. Travel mode: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature. Measurement: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters which is most appropriate for walking. If driving is selected as travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement. Travel increments: The travel increments for walking are loaded by default and based on evidence from literature. If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these default values. If the selected travel mode is driving the equal measurement increments should be in minutes, and informed by the local context  (for example, if the user knows that the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increment input would be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30). Step 2: The algorithm aggregates all raster layers created in step 1 by calculating the mean score for each pixel. Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory. A value of 5 identifies areas that are within the catchment defined by the smallest travel increment for all amenities (i.e., the areas where accessibility for women is highest). A value of 0 indicates areas that are outside of the catchment defined by the maximum travel increment for all amenities (i.e., no amenities are accessible to women from these areas).

Isochrones are derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network with the use of travel distances or times as input to estimate ease of access to the public transport stops at five incrementally increasing measurement intervals. The largest interval being the maximum distance or time women would travel to reach these locations. The algorithm produces five catchment areas based on the road network. A scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 is assigned to the catchment area polygons, reflecting the decreasing order of accessibility. Areas outside these catchment areas receive a score of zero. Input: Point locations (.shp) of public transport stops. Travel mode: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature. Measurement: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters which is most appropriate for walking. If driving is selected as travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement. Travel increments: The travel increments for walking are loaded by default and based on evidence from literature. If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these default values. If the selected travel mode is driving the equal measurement increments should be in minutes, and informed by the local context (for example, if the user knows that the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increment input would be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30).

A polygon (.shp) for blocks.Process: The user inputs all the required layers. The territory is then divided into 100m by 100m rasters.If there:- No features in a raster cell, a value of 0 is assigned.- Is 1 feature in a raster cell, a value of 3 is assigned.- Are 2 or more features in a raster cell, a value of 5 is assigned.Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory.

A value of 0 indicates areas where there are no roads at all, and thus active transport is assumed to be impossible.",

Drought: Global Drought Hazard based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)Step 1 For each layer representing a different class of environmental hazard, the input layer is set. The algorithm reclassifies the input field such that low-risk areas are assigned a score of 5, medium-risk areas are assigned a score of 2, and high-risk areas are assigned a score of 0. Step 2 The algorithm identifies all raster layers created in step 1 and aggregates them by calculating the mean score for each pixel. The default raster output filename does not need to be altered unless the user wishes. Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory. A value of 5 indicates areas where natural disaster risk is lowest. A value of 0 indicates areas where environmental hazard risk is highest. ",

Brief summary of the framework The framework identifies 23 factors that are considered key to women\u2019s ability to access employment opportunities. Due to data constraints only 21 of the 23 could be incorporated into the tool. These 21 factors are evaluated individually to create a single raster output layer for each factor with scores ranging from 0 to 5. Factor layers are aggregated into 4 dimensions (individual, contextual, accessibility and place characterization) using a multicriteria evaluation as described in the methodology document. Dimensions are also represented by a single raster layer with scores ranging from 0 to 5. Finally, dimensions can be further combined to produce a final aggregate output of scores ranging from 0 to 5. The range of scores within each layer can broadly be interpreted as follows:  Score range      Class     Interpretation0.00 - 0.50        0            Not enabling 0.51 - 1.50        1            Very low enabling 1.51 - 2.50        2            Low enabling 2.51 - 3.50        3           Moderately enabling3.51 - 4.50        4           Enabling 4.51 - 5.00        5           Highly enabling   Confidence Level An overall confidence level is assigned to the final aggregate output based on the percentage of factors included in the aggregation. The level of confidence in the overall result can be interpreted as follows: 0-24% = Very low confidence 25-49% = Low confidence 50-74% = Medium confidence 75-89% = High confidence 90-100% = Very high confidence InsightsThe raw aggregate scores can be used in combination with information relating to the distribution of women and renewable energy sites to draw further insights. The insights tab groups population counts into three categories based on the lower, median, and upper quartile range of data to identify areas, of low, medium, and high numbers of women. These groupings are then combined with score classes to create 15 score-population classes listed below: 1 - Very low enablement, low population 2 - Very low enablement, medium population 3 - Very low enablement, high population 4 - Low enablement, low population 5 - Low enablement, medium population 6 - Low enablement, high population 7 - Moderately enabling, low population 8 - Moderately enabling, medium population 9 - Moderately enabling, high population 10 - Enabling, low population 11 - Enabling, medium population 12 - Enabling, high population 13 - Highly enabling, low population 14 - Highly enabling, medium population 15 - Highly enabling, high population ",

The boundary layer must be in vector format (.shp); Step 3: Set the CRS by selecting the EPSG code for the region from the drop-down list. The recommended CRS for the tool to function optimally is the UTM Zone for the region.  A list of valid UTMs for SIDS can be found in the user manual; Step 4:  Set the preferred resolution of the raster output. The default and recommended resolution for the raster output is 100m, but this can be altered if preferred. A higher resolution (smaller pixel) will produce more detailed outputs but will require more processing power. ",
