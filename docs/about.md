### 🔍 GEEST Approach


GEEST uses a **Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE)** framework to evaluate various socio-economic, infrastructural, and environmental factors that influence women's access to employment and business opportunities. This open-source tool consolidates data from multiple sectors to produce **visual maps** that highlight areas where women can flourish, helping to shape gender-responsive initiatives.


#### GEEST serves to:
- **Identify employment and business opportunities** for women across multiple sectors.
- **Guide investment decisions** that promote gender-inclusive infrastructure and reduce barriers.
