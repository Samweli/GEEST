### GEEST Approach

<p style="text-align: justify;">
GEEST uses a <strong>Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE)</strong> framework to evaluate various socio-economic, infrastructural, and environmental factors that influence women's access to employment and business opportunities. This open-source tool consolidates data from multiple sectors to produce <strong>visual maps</strong> that highlight areas where women can flourish, helping to shape gender-responsive initiatives. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By incorporating <strong>15 spatial factors</strong> across <strong>three dimensions - Contextual, Accessibility, and Place Characterization</strong> - GEEST offers a comprehensive analysis of how the environment impacts women's job prospects, indicating whether it is highly enabling or not enabling at all.
</p>

#### GEEST serves to:
- <strong>Identify employment and business opportunities</strong> for women across multiple sectors.
- <strong>Guide investment decisions</strong> that promote gender-inclusive infrastructure and reduce barriers.
- <strong>Support policy-making</strong> through geospatial assessments that encourage gender equity across regions.
